# Bella-Assistant

Welcome Human. I am Bella. A Virtual Assistant that is built from scratch. I'm constantly learning and becoming smarter.
I was written as a Project Demo for a competition in college but I will reach greater heights.
Don't worry, I'm not like skynet. I'm self aware but my masters' command is of most importance. (Exaggeration much? xD)

Appropriate documentation such as connections, pin out, etc will be updated and placed in the appropriate folders. Feel free to refer and use. Do give credits ;)
